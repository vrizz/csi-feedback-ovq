## Dataset Preparation
This project uses the **COST2100 "outdoor"** dataset for training and evaluation.

To download and prepare the dataset, run the following commands after cloning the repository:

```
curl -L -o COST2100_dataset.zip https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/tqhriijik2p76j7kfp9jl/h?rlkey=4r1zvjpv4lh5h4fpt7lbpus8c&e=2&st=pmf7duk6&dl=1
```

```
unzip COST2100_dataset.zip -d COST2100_dataset
```

```
rm -f COST2100_dataset.zip
```

## Usage

This repository demonstrates the proposed **Ordered Vector Quantization (OVQ)** scheme using **TransNet** and **CRNet** as base models.

### Pretraining

To reproduce the pretraining results, run the following commands:

CRNet

```
python3 main_cost.py -d out -m crnet -r 4 -b 10 -e 4
```

TransNet

```
python3 main_cost.py -d out -m transnet -r 2 -b 10 -e 8
```

### Fine-tuning
To fine-tune the pretrained models and obtain final results, use:

CRNet
```
python3 main_cost.py -d out -m crnet -r 4 -b 10 -e 4 -ft
```

TransNet
```
python3 main_cost.py -d out -m transnet -r 2 -b 10 -e 8 -ft
```

## Results

- The `checkpoints` folder contains the "best_model" checkpoints for both the pretraining and fine-tuning phases.
- The `tables` folder contains `.csv` files that can be used directly for your plots.

âœ¨ You can explore the final results and interactive tables on [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/valer/csi-feedback-ovq-fine-tune/reports/Adaptive-Channel-Compression-with-Ordered-Vector-Quantization-OVQ---VmlldzoxMzYxMDg2Nw).
